# law-data

Law school dataset originally from [^1].

The Law School Admission Council conducted a survey across 163 law schools in the United States. 
It contains information on 21,790 law students such as their entrance exam scores (`LSAT`), their grade-point average (`GPA`) 
collected prior to law school, and their first year average grade (`FYA`). Given this data, a school may wish to predict 
if an applicant will have a high FYA. The school would also like to make sure these predictions are not biased by an 
individual’s race and sex. However, the `LSAT`, `GPA`, and `FYA` scores, may be biased due to social factors.
